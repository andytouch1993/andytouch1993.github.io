When developing a web application or mobile application, there are two main parts. The Front-End, the visual interface that the user interacts with, and the Back-End, the engine making the entire application possible. 

Let us use Facebook for example. When you go to www.facebook.com, the page you see would be Front-End of the website. Here, there are different elements of the user inteface. You can see a log in form for existing users, and a sign-up form for new users. When you type in your information on the landing page whether you are logging in or creating a new Facebook profile, you are sending a request to the Back-End. 

The Back-End is where all the behind the scenes action takes place. The Back-End contains all of the code and databases used in or web application. In our Facebook example, we could have databases for all the users of Facebook, and for each user, we can have databases to keep up with our Friends, Likes, Posts etc. Along with our databases, we will have our main code. This code will provide the methods of how the application works. In a social media site like Facebok, when we add a friend to our friends list, a method is performed that adds our new friend to our personal friend database.

Both the Front-End and Back-End are crucial in the development of an app. An app with great functionality can become insignificant if the Front-End interface feels impossible to operate. At application with a beautify user interface but no Back-End functionality shares the same faith. It is important to takle both the Front and Back End from all sides to create the best user experience!
