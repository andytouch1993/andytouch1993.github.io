I knew at a young age that I wanted to be a creator. LEGO's really helped spark my passion for creativity. I loved to build new LEGOs out of scratch, and knowing that I was the architect of my newly designed toy gave my a sense of pride. Now that I am older, I would like for my career to have that same type of feeling. Web developming is like giving an artist a blank piece of paper and a pencil (or whatever his or her medium may be). The possibility are endless and it is a very powerful tool. This is what attracts me most to web development. You are the architect of the web.
